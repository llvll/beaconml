### Machine learning in action for iBeacon-based advertising

Simple demo to show the machine learning in action for iBeacon-based advertising.

Supplied CSV contains the collected data from a shopping mall, where iBeacons are installed.

Every record defines the parameters for a successful case - visitor has entered a store or clicked
on a mobile app's banner / button.

This code is using TinyLearn module, which simplifies the classification tasks with Scikit-Learn and Pandas.

TinyLearn module is still at an early development stage. Please use with caution and feel free to ask any questions: oleg.v.puzanov@gmail.com
