# BeaconML
### Machine learning in action for iBeacon-based advertising

Simple demo to show the machine learning in action for iBeacon-based advertising.

Supplied CSV contains the collected data from a shopping mall, where iBeacons are installed.

Every record defines the parameters for a successful case - visitor has entered a store or clicked
on a mobile app's banner / button.

IPython Notebook (.ipynb file) is included for step-by-step execution of the demo application with extra comments.

This code is using TinyLearn framework, which simplifies the classification tasks with Python and the following modules: 

* Scikit-Learn
* Pandas
* Seqlearn
* OpenCV
* Mlpy

TinyLearn framework is still at an early development stage. Please use with caution and feel free to ask any questions: oleg.v.puzanov@gmail.com
